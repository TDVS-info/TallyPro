The files in this directory are the 3D models developed in TinkerCAD for the Tally Pro tally light system.
You are welcome to use them to build your own lights, with the proviso that you can not sell those lights.
We are always open to improving our product.  I you can think of a better way to implement the design, 
please make a branch and let us know what you are doing via email at info.tdvideoservices.com.
