The code included here can be used by you to program and create your own tally light.

What you can't do is sell one commercially.

All of the software here is based on other's work and so is open source, but we hope you will use this resource to better understand your Tally Pro and purchase our hardware running it.

This code was developed on the Arduino IDE version 2.0, and is designed to run on a NodeMCU 12E ESP8266 module.

We are always open to improving our code.  If you can think of a better way to implement a function, or a way to shrink the code, please make a branch and let us know of what you are doing by emailing info@tdvideoservices.com.

Thanks, and happy Tallying!
